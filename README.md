Turn unstructured HTML pages into structured data. The OpenScraping library can extract information from HTML pages using a JSON config file with xPath rules. It can scrape even multi-level complex objects such as tables and forum posts. 

This is the **C#** version. A separate but similar **Node.js** library is located [here](https://github.com/zmarty/openscraping-lib-nodejs).

**This repo is under construction.**
